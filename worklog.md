Task: Fix checkout "Bayar Sekarang" to auto-redirect to beranda after payment success

Work Log:
- Fixed double-transaction bug: checkout page's handlePay was creating a transaction AND then PaymentDialog was creating another one. Changed handlePay to just open PaymentDialog (let PaymentDialog handle transaction creation)
- Modified PaymentDialog to auto-redirect to beranda after payment success (1.5s delay after showing success message)
- Changed checkout page's onSuccess callback to always redirect to /pembukaan (beranda)
- Verified webhook creates Pengguna + Pembeli records correctly for both mock and real payment modes
- Verified both homepage and checkout page render correctly via agent-browser

Stage Summary:
- "Bayar Sekarang" now opens PaymentDialog directly (no double-transaction)
- After successful payment (mock or real), user is auto-redirected to /pembukaan (beranda) after 1.5s
- Data from webhook creates both Pengguna and Pembeli records, so they appear in "halaman pengguna" and "tab pembeli"
- No compilation errors
